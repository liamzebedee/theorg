The Organisation
================

The Organisation is an **occupational roleplaying game** that is completely on-chain.

 - You play as citizen or police.
 - The citizen's job is to make money by creating products and selling them.
 - The police's job is to enforce the mandate of the organisation. They can ban products.
 - The organisation is the overarching body which dictates the rules of gameplay.
   They are the game's designer, incarnated as an on-chain DAO that all players belong to.

Receipes are open designs for creating new items. Anyone can create a recipe by implementing a smart contract that specifies various types of input items that make an output. 

The game is free-to-play for any Ethereum user with an ENS domain. Players receive 2,000,000 ORG at genesis and are able to choose between citizen or police.

Police receive a salary of 500,000 ORG per in-game epoch. The salary and length of an epoch is set by governance. 

Governance of the organisation is done by quadratic voting, using their in-game `ORG` as voting credits. 

## Design ethos.

This game is a [Loot-like](https://www.lootproject.com/). What does that mean?

> Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use Loot in any way you want.

Our contracts implement a minimal set of functionality for specifying recipes, fabricating items, trade and currency, and governing gameplay. The rest is up to you!

## Bridges.

TheOrg will be deployed on its own EVM sidechain, for anyone to play for minimal cost.

Any token (DAI, Loot NFT's) may be bridged to TheOrg via a permissionless multichain portal. This brings outerworld assets in-game.

The in-game currency, ORG, is an ERC20 and all in-game items are ERC721's.

## Possibilities

 - multichain portal to Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum for transferring tokens in/out of TheOrg in-game economy.
 - on-chain bribes for police officers.
 - TheORG adding additional player attributes like class, title, items, equipment, etc. based on governance.
 - increasing police salaries or decreasing them?
 - paying police more often by reducing epoch length.
